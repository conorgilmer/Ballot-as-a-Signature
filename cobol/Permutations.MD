#Permutations in COBOL
Just some fun and frolicks with COBOL
Using GNUCobol to calculate the FACTORIAL (n!) and the Permutations nPr= (n!/(n-r)!)

Factorial is an intrinsic keyword hence you import a c-library to use it, it seems like cheating! so i messed round with Perfrom varying to calcualte both factorials and permutaions
