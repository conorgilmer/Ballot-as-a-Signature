# Permutations in COBOL
Just some fun and frolicks with COBOL
Using GNUCobol to calculate the FACTORIAL (n!) and the Permutations nPr= (n!/(n-r)!)

Factorial is an intrinsic keyword hence you import a c-library to use it, it seems like cheating! so i messed round with Perfrom varying to calcualte both factorials and permutaions.

## Programmes
- Fact.cob - Calculate a Factorial using a loop 
- FactC.cob - Calculate a Factorial using the intrinsic function
- STVPermutaions.cob - get value for n and r and calculate nPr
- STVPermutationsnPr.COB - calculate nPr for all values of r
