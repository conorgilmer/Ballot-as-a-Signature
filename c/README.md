# Permutation and Combinations in C
Here is a few programmes to generate the permutations and combinations the difference is a permutations is a combination of values in an array without repetition, where combinations elements can be repeated and hence their are more potential combinations than permutations.

This is relevant in Proportional Representaiton - Single Transferable vote elections, since the number of "permutations" of votes cpossible if you vote or transfer to r number of candidates out of a possible n number of candidates is the permutaiton formuala nPr.

## Permutations
nPr = n!/(n-r)!

## Combinations
nCr = (n!/(n-r)!)r!
